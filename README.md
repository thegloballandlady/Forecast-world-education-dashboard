### Project Overview
---

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of global education trends, leveraging data on government expenditure, literacy rates, student enrollment, and pupil-teacher ratios. 
The project employs Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for data transformation and visualization. 
The goal is to offer insights into education systems worldwide and facilitate data-driven decision-making for policymakers, educators, and researchers.

### Dataset Details
---
The dataset comprises the following fields:
* country: Name of the country
* country_code: Unique code representing each country
* year: Year of data collection
* gov_exp_pct_gdp: Government expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP
* lit_rate_adult_pct: Adult literacy rate (percentage)
* pri_comp_rate_pct: Primary completion rate (percentage)
* pupil_teacher_primary: Pupil-to-teacher ratio in primary schools
* pupil_teacher_secondary: Pupil-to-teacher ratio in secondary schools
* school_enrol_primary_pct: School enrollment in primary education (percentage)
* school_enrol_secondary_pct: School enrollment in secondary education (percentage)
* school_enrol_tertiary_pct: School enrollment in tertiary education (percentage)


### Data Enhancements
---
The dataset was enhanced with the following columns during transformation in Power BI:

* Quarter: Extracted from the date to analyze trends by fiscal quarters
* Month Name: Derived to provide monthly insights


### Dashboards and Insights
---
The project includes several dashboards created in Power BI to visualize key metrics:

* Sum of Literacy Rate by Country
Displays the total literacy rates per country, providing a comparative view of educational achievements globally.

* Number of Tertiary Students Enrolled Each Year
Highlights trends in tertiary education enrollment across countries over the years.

* Number of Secondary Pupils Enrolled Each Year
Tracks annual enrollment trends in secondary schools, showcasing growth or decline in access to education.

* Number of Teachers Present in Each Country by Quarter
Presents the availability of teaching staff across primary and secondary schools, segmented by fiscal quarters.

* Sum of Students and Teachers in Secondary Schools by Month
Analyzes the relationship between student populations and teaching capacity in secondary schools on a monthly basis.

*Sum of Students and Teachers in Primary Schools by Month
Provides insights into the monthly dynamics of student-teacher ratios in primary education.


### Tools Used
---
* Excel: Data cleaning, ensuring accuracy and uniformity
* Power BI: Data transformation, dashboard creation, and visualization



### Key Findings
---
* Patterns in government expenditure on education highlight regional disparities.
* Countries with higher pupil-to-teacher ratios often experience lower literacy and enrollment rates.
* Monthly and quarterly analyses reveal fluctuations in teacher availability and student enrollment, emphasizing the importance of resource allocation timing.



### Conclusion
---

This project sheds light on critical aspects of global education, offering a data-driven perspective for improving educational outcomes. Stakeholders can utilize the dashboards and insights for planning, policy formulation, and addressing gaps in education systems.
